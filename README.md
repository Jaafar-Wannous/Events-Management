# Events Management API

A Laravel-based Events Management application designed to serve as a robust REST API. This project focuses on delivering JSON-based data, implementing user authentication, and leveraging advanced backend features like task scheduling, background processing, and rate limiting.

## Features

### 1. **Event Browsing**
   - Retrieve a list of all events in JSON format.
   - Supports structured and scalable data for event management.

### 2. **Event Creation**
   - Post new events, available only to authenticated users.
   - Learn and implement secure user authentication workflows.

### 3. **User Authentication**
   - Create new users and manage sign-in sessions.
   - Enforce authentication for protected routes like event creation.

### 4. **Notifications**
   - Send notifications via email for specific actions.
   - Learn email configuration and usage within Laravel.

### 5. **Task Scheduling**
   - Utilize Laravel's task scheduling to manage background processes.
   - Examples include sending periodic notifications or cleaning up old data.

### 6. **Background Processing**
   - Use queues for handling time-consuming tasks asynchronously.
   - Ensure optimal API performance by offloading heavy operations.

### 7. **Rate Limiting**
   - Protect the API from abuse by implementing rate limiting.
   - Ensure fair usage and prevent overloading of the server.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel**: Backend framework for API development.
- **Postman**: Tool for testing and interacting with the API.
- **Queues**: For background task management.
- **Email Notifications**: Configured to send notifications directly from the API.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/events-management-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Set up the environment:
   - Create a `.env` file and configure your database connection.
   - Run migrations:
     ```bash

     ```

5. Serve the application:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```
   Access the API at `http://localhost:8000`.

6. Test the API with Postman or any API testing tool.

## Future Enhancements

- Add user roles for managing different levels of access.
- Implement filtering and sorting for event lists.
- Add more notification channels (e.g., SMS or push notifications).
